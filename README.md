# 42_ft__irc

- [ ] port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming IRC connections.
- [ ] password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries to connect to your server.
- [CHECK] The server must be capable of handling multiple clients at the same time and never hang.
- [x] Forking is not allowed. All I/O operations must be non-blocking.
- [x] Only 1 poll() (or equivalent) can be used for handling all these operations (read, write, but also listen, and so forth).
- [ ] Several IRC clients exist. You have to choose one of them as a reference. Your reference client will be used during the evaluation process.
- [ ] Your reference client must be able to connect to your server without encountering any error.
- [x] Communication between client and server has to be done via TCP/IP (v4 or v6).
- [ ] Using your reference client with your server must be similar to using it with any official IRC server. However, you only have to implement the following features:
    - [ ] You must be able to authenticate, set a nickname, a username, join a channel, send and receive private messages using your reference client.
    - [ ] All the messages sent from one client to a channel have to be forwarded to every other client that joined the channel.
    - [ ] You must have operators and regular users.
    - [ ] Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel operators:
        - [ ] KICK - Eject a client from the channel
        - [ ] INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
        - [ ] TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
        - [ ] MODE - Change the channelâ€™s mode:
            - [ ] i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
            - [ ] t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators
            - [ ] k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
            - [ ] o: Give/take channel operator privilege
            - [ ] l: Set/remove the user limit to channel
- [ ] Of course, you are expected to write a clean code.
